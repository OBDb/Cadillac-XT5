    description: "The Cadillac XT5 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV that replaced the SRX in Cadillac's lineup. Built on GM's C1XX platform, it features Cadillac's Art & Science design language with crisp lines, distinctive vertical lighting elements, and an overall more refined appearance than its predecessor. Initially powered by a 3.6L V6 engine producing 310 HP paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, a turbocharged 2.0L four-cylinder engine with 237 HP was added in 2020 as the new base powertrain. Both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations are available. The interior offers a driver-focused design with a combination of premium materials including leather, aluminum, and real wood accents, with Cadillac's CUE infotainment system displayed on an 8-inch touchscreen. Technology features include available night vision, a 360-degree camera system, and driver assistance features. A significant refresh for the 2020 model year updated the exterior styling, revised the interior with improved materials and a rotary controller for the infotainment system, and introduced the new base engine. The XT5 is positioned in the highly competitive luxury mid-size crossover segment and represents an important volume model for Cadillac, balancing luxury amenities with practical utility. Throughout its production run, the XT5 has maintained Cadillac's focus on distinctive styling and technology while offering a more refined driving experience than the SRX it replaced."
